Que-7 What is payment system and it's characteristics 

Ans:

refer from pdf

Que-8	Electronic payment systems (RTGS, NEFT, IMPS) used for transferring funds between bank accounts.


Ans:

** NEFT (National Electronic Fund Transfer) 
> National Electronic Funds Transfer or NEFT is the most commonly used 
  online payment option to transfer money from one bank account to another. 
  Usually, salary transfers by companies are done using NEFT. The funds are 
  transferred on a deferred settlement basis, which implies that the money is 
  transferred in batches. There is no maximum limit but this depends from one 
  bank to another. For instance, the retail banking limit set by SBI is Rs. 10 
  lakhs. Based on the amount being transferred the bank can charge an amount 
  from Rs 2.50 to Rs 25. The money can be transferred only during the bank 
  working days. The transactions cannot be completed over the weekends and 
  on bank holidays. It will be completed on the next working day. Thus, instant 
  transactions can’t be made using NEFT. Various requirements for conducting 
  an NEFT transfer are: 
         • Recipient’s name 
         • Recipient’s bank name 
         • Recipients’ account number 
         • IFSC code of the beneficiary bank 


** RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) 
> Money can be transferred from one bank to another on a real-time basis using 
  Real Time Gross Settlement or RTGS method. There is no maximum transfer 
  limit, but the minimum is Rs. 2 lakhs. The transactions are processed 
  throughout the RTGS business hours. Usually, the amount is remitted within 
  30-minutes. To be able to transfer money through RTGS, it is required for the 
  sender and the receiver bank branch to be RTGS enabled. It costs a little 
  more than NEFT. But still, it will not cost you more than Rs. 30 for 
  transactions up to Rs. 5 lakhs. The fee varies from one bank to another. 
  Various requirements for conducting a RTGS are: 
         • Amount to be sent 
         • Account number of the remitter or sender 
         • Name of the recipient or beneficiary 
         • Account number of the beneficiary 
         • Beneficiary’s bank and branch name 
         • IFSC code of the receiving branch 
         • Sender to receiver information, if any

 
** IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) 
> An IMPS sends instant payments. The money is transferred instantaneously 
  through mobile phones using this interbank electronic fund transfer service. 
  You can make the transactions 24x7x365 across banks including all 
  weekends and bank holidays. The money can be transferred using phones, 
  ATMs, Mobile Money Identifier (MMID) and internet banking. The idea is 
  simple to allow users to make payments with the mobile number of the 
  beneficiary. Various requirements for conducting IMPS are: 
        • MMID of the Recipient 
        • 7 Digit MMID Number 
        • MMID of the receiver 
        • Name of the beneficiary 
        • Beneficiary’s mobile number 
        • Account Number of the recipient 
        • IFSC Codes of the beneficiary bank

Que 22.	Examine how biometric authentication (such as fingerprint and facial recognition) is reshaping digital payment security.


Ans:Here is a simple and easy-to-understand answer for your exam question worth 10 marks:

---

**Q. Examine how biometric authentication (such as fingerprint and facial recognition) is reshaping digital payment security.**

**Answer:**

Biometric authentication uses a person’s unique physical features like fingerprints, face, voice, or eyes to verify their identity. It is now being widely used in digital payment systems to make transactions more secure and fast.

Here’s how it is reshaping digital payment security:

1. **Stronger Security:**
   Biometrics are hard to copy or steal, unlike passwords or PINs. This reduces the chances of fraud or identity theft.

2. **Quick and Easy:**
   People don’t need to remember passwords. They can simply use their fingerprint or face to make a payment, which saves time.

3. **Less Dependence on Devices:**
   Even if someone loses their card or phone, no one else can use it without their biometric data.

4. **Used by Popular Apps and Devices:**
   Today, apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and banking apps allow payments through fingerprints or facial recognition. Phones like iPhones and Android devices support this feature.

5. **Improved User Experience:**
   It makes the payment process smoother, faster, and user-friendly, especially for people who are not very tech-savvy.

6. **Helps Prevent Unauthorized Access:**
   If a phone or app requires biometric verification, it stops others from making payments without the user’s permission.

**Conclusion:**
Biometric authentication is making digital payments safer, quicker, and more convenient. As technology grows, it will play an even bigger role in protecting users from fraud and improving trust in online payments.

Ans:

Thank you for your feedback! Here’s an improved and more structured **10-mark answer** in simple, clear language that explains the **importance of KYC and AML in cross-border transactions** more effectively:

---

### **Importance of Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) in Cross-Border Transactions**

KYC and AML policies are essential tools used by banks and financial institutions to **prevent fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing**, especially in **cross-border (international) transactions**. Here's why they are so important:

---

### 1. **Customer Identification**

KYC helps banks **verify the identity** of their customers. In cross-border transactions, this is very important to **ensure the person or business is real and trustworthy**. Without knowing who the customer is, there is a high risk of dealing with criminals or fake accounts.

---

### 2. **Prevention of Money Laundering**

AML policies are designed to **detect and stop illegal money movements**. Criminals often try to "clean" their black money by sending it across borders. AML systems track suspicious transactions and help prevent this.

---

### 3. **Stopping Terrorism Financing**

Terrorist groups often try to move funds secretly across countries. KYC and AML help in **tracking where the money is coming from and going to**, making it harder for such groups to get financial support.

---

### 4. **Following International Laws**

Many countries follow global rules set by organizations like the **FATF (Financial Action Task Force)**. If a country or bank does not follow KYC/AML laws, it may **face penalties or get banned from doing business internationally**.

---

### 5. **Protecting the Financial System**

Cross-border transactions involve big amounts of money. If there is no proper checking, the system can be used for illegal purposes. KYC and AML keep the **financial system safe, clean, and trusted** by people and countries.

---

### 6. **Reducing Fraud and Identity Theft**

By verifying customers properly, KYC helps reduce cases where someone **pretends to be someone else** to steal money or commit fraud in international transactions.

---

### 7. **Building Global Trust**

When countries and banks follow strong KYC and AML rules, **other countries feel more confident doing business with them**. This helps in increasing safe international trade and investment.

---

### **Conclusion:**

KYC and AML are not just formalities—they are **powerful tools to protect the global financial system**. In cross-border transactions, where the risk is higher, these policies ensure that **money flows safely, legally, and transparently**. They help fight crime, improve trust, and support healthy international trade.
